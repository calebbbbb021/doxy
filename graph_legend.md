# Graph Legend

This page explains how to interpret the graphs that are generated by Doxygen.

Consider the following example:

```cpp
/*! Invisible class because of truncation */
class Invisible { };
 
/*! Truncated class, inheritance relation is hidden */
class Truncated : public Invisible { };
 
/* Class not documented with doxygen comments */
class Undocumented { };
 
/*! Class that is inherited using public inheritance */
class PublicBase : public Truncated { };
 
/*! A template class */
template<class T> class Templ { };
 
/*! Class that is inherited using protected inheritance */
class ProtectedBase { };
 
/*! Class that is inherited using private inheritance */
class PrivateBase { };
 
/*! Class that is used by the Inherited class */
class Used { };
 
/*! Super class that inherits a number of other classes */
class Inherited : public PublicBase,
                  protected ProtectedBase,
                  private PrivateBase,
                  public Undocumented,
                  public Templ<int>
{
  private:
    Used *m_usedClass;
};
```

This will result in the following graph:

## Boxes

The boxes in the above graph have the following meaning:

- **Filled Gray Box**: Represents the struct or class for which the graph is generated.
- **Box with Black Border**: Denotes a documented struct or class.
- **Box with Gray Border**: Denotes an undocumented struct or class.
- **Box with Red Border**: Denotes a documented struct or class for which not all inheritance/containment relations are shown. A graph is truncated if it does not fit within the specified boundaries.

## Arrows

The arrows have the following meaning:

- **Dark Blue Arrow**: Visualizes a public inheritance relation between two classes.
- **Dark Green Arrow**: Visualizes a protected inheritance relation.
- **Dark Red Arrow**: Visualizes a private inheritance relation.
- **Purple Dashed Arrow**: Indicates if a class is contained or used by another class. The arrow is labelled with the variable(s) through which the pointed class or struct is accessible.
- **Yellow Dashed Arrow**: Denotes a relation between a template instance and the template class it was instantiated from. The arrow is labelled with the template parameters of the instance.
